# Exemplar Usage

In this directory we provide exemplar inputs for our Plugin, a description of the process for which the exemplars represent and how to generate alternative instances using the sub directory called "maker".

Exemplar Inputs:
 - An endogenous event log, 
   - endo_log.xes
 - Several exo-panels to instanitanate xPM using our Plugin, and
   - exo_panel_01.xes
   - exo_panel_02.xes
   - exo_panel_03.xes
 - A Petri net with Data control flow model
   - model.pnml

## Process 

The control flow the process, from which we build upon for this exemplar can be seen as a Petri net below:
